# Joke Classification Into Humor Styles

This project is a web application that classifies jokes into different humor styles using machine learning models. It allows users to input a joke and get a classification along with explanations and encouragement based on the humor style detected.

## Features

- **Humor Style Classification**: The app classifies jokes into one of the following humor styles:
  - Self-Enhancing
  - Self-Deprecating
  - Affiliative
  - Aggressive
  - Neutral

- **Detailed Feedback**: After classification, the app provides an explanation of the detected humor style and offers encouragement or advice based on the result.

- **Probability Display**: The app also shows the model's confidence (probability) in the prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaryKenneth/nb_humor_style_classifier_app.git
   cd nb_humor_style_classifier_app
   ```

2. **Install the Required Packages**

   Install the dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**

   Ensure you have the trained XGBoost model file (`ali_xgboost_humour_model.pkl`) in the root directory of the project.

### Running the Application

Start the Flask web application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

### Usage

1. Go to the homepage of the web app.
2. Enter your joke in the text box.
3. Submit the joke to see its humor style classification along with an explanation and encouragement.
4. The prediction probability will also be displayed to indicate how confident the model is in its prediction.
